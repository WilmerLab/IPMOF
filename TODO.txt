IPMOF To Do List:
-------------------------------------
1) High Priority

- Implement job server.
  - Main algorithm will create the energy maps and submit different jobs for each interpenetration.

- If base mof > mobile mof mobile mof should be extended at least to the size of base mof
  - Lets say for two cubic MOFs base_a/mobile_a = 1.2 -> Extend mobile to 2x2x2

- For CoRE database keep a single directory containing CoRE MOFs.
When a selection is performed from the database copy all the MOFs to the local 'mof' folder
and read the files from there. In this way there is no need for a directory change.

2) Near Future

- Add file format options for reading/writing MOF files. (ase, openbabel - pybel)

- Change naming of output structures.
  - S1_S2_1.xyz    => Single unit cell
  - S1_S2_1C.xyz   => Single unit cell colored
  - S1_S2_1P.xyz   => Packed unit cell
  - S1_S2_1PC.xyz  => Packed unit cell colored

- Decide how to handle sim_par and sim_dir. Multiple sim_par files for one job?

- Add separate directory selection for base and mobile mofs.
Use current combination directory as the default selection.

- Update CoRE database

- mol2_read() -> Read atom names from 6th column instead of 2nd

3) Far Future

- HTML export

- Common unit cell parameters for hetero interpenetration
